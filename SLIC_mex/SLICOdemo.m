%======================================================================
%Input:
%[1] 8 bit images (color or grayscale)
%[2] Number of required superpixels (optional, default is 200)
%
%Ouputs are:
%[1] labels (in raster scan order)
%[2] number of labels in the image (same as the number of returned
%superpixels
%
%NOTES:
%[1] number of returned superpixels may be different from the input
%number of superpixels.
%[2] you must compile the C file using mex slicomex.c before using the code
%below

% How is SLICO different from SLIC?
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
% 1. SLICO does not need compactness factor as input. It is calculated
% automatically
% 2. The automatic value adapts to the content of the superpixel. So,
% SLICO is better suited for texture and non-texture regions
% 3. The advantages 1 and 2 come at the cost of slightly poor boundary
% adherences to regions.
% 4. This is also a very small computational overhead (but speed remains
% almost as fast as SLIC.
% 5. There is a small memory overhead too w.r.t. SLIC.
% 6. Overall, the advantages are likely to outweigh the small disadvantages
% for most applications of superpixels.
